**Project Idea(s):** _Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 2)_
### Idea 1

* TravelGuide:
    * Problem to solve: When traveling, it can be hard to keep track of everything you need. We’d like to create an all-inclusive streamlined process for traveling.
      * BIG CHALLENGE:
         * Multi-user coordination (different people going on the same trip might want to do different things, need to account for preferences, scheduling, etc)
         * Loads in data from Google calendar?
    * Critical Features:
       * Transportation (Plane tickets, bus tickets, uber/lyft, etc)
         * Why from a user perspective?: Difficult to coordinate different types of travel
         * Challenges: 
            * Web scraping for all possible options, generate a ranking w/o overlap
            * Lots of repeated data
            * Real-time changes in options can cause issues
       * Housing
         * Why from a user perspective?: Need a place to stay
         * Challenges:
            * Comparing airbnb vs hotel vs motel etc…
            * Real-time changes in options can cause issues
       * Necessary documents
         * Why from a user perspective?: Easy to forget, don’t want to be stranded
         * Challenges:
            * How do I know what I need? What are official sources
            * Check expiration dates
       * Travel agencies
         * Why from a user perspective?: Not many users are confident in what to do once they get to the travel destination. 
         * Challenges:
            * Which ones are trustworthy
            * Aligning within schedule
       * Leisure/Attractions
         * Why from a user perspective?: Traveling implies fun things 
         * Challenges:
            * How do we know what type of activities the user prefers? 
            * Aligning with schedule
            * Real-time updates
### Idea 2

We need a good platform for podcasts!
 
Welcome to Podcool. We’ve always been interested in listening to more podcasts, but we've never found a particularly great platform to conveniently listen to them. Additionally, we feel as though the existing platforms are not great for content creators, either. Our idea is to make a podcast platform that's more like YouTube rather than Spotify, iTunes, or Overcast. Some features that would be interesting (and necessary) to implement:

* Monetization for content creators
  * Podcast creators have a lot to deal with when deciding on a business model: sponsors, donations, advertisements, merchandise, etc. Often there is a barrier to entry of a certain high number of downloads per episode to be able to monetize in these ways.
  * Proposal: host podcasts for free, and allow monetization with the click of a button (like how YouTube works with videos!), or maybe Patreon style monthly donation
  * Challenge: how do we scalably host podcasts? Isn’t that a lot of data?
  
* Provide actionable data
  * Offer a portal to detailed/actionable data on a podcast's audience demographics, traffic sources, minutes watched, etc.
  * Allows creators to build an audience and increase engagement
  * Challenge: what data is valuable? How is it collected and managed?
 
* Good content discovery system
  * Easy to share podcasts - like YouTube videos, they should be easily embedded and intuitive to navigate
  * Show recommendations for similar content (implement a collaborative filtering recommendation system)
  * Challenge: how should the recommendation system function? What determines if podcasts are “similar,” and therefore should be recommended?
 
* Ease of audience engagement
  * Comment section! It allows for a community to form, for experiences to be shared, and for creators to get feedback on their work.
  * Challenge: again, that's a lot of data! How do we implement this system? How do we keep track of user information?
