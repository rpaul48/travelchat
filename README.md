**Project Idea(s):** _Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 2)_
### Idea 1

* TravelGuide:
 * Problem to solve: When traveling, it can be hard to keep track of everything you need. We’d like to create an all-inclusive streamlined process for traveling.
      * BIG CHALLENGE:
* Multi-user coordination (different people going on the same trip might want to do different things, need to account for preferences, scheduling, etc)
* Loads in data from Google calendar?
Critical Features:
Transportation (Plane tickets, bus tickets, uber/lyft, etc)
Why from a user perspective?: Difficult to coordinate different types of travel
Challenges: 
Web scraping for all possible options, generate a ranking w/o overlap
Lots of repeated data
Real-time changes in options can cause issues
Housing
Why from a user perspective?: Need a place to stay
Challenges:
Comparing airbnb vs hotel vs motel etc…
Real-time changes in options can cause issues
Necessary documents
Why from a user perspective?: Easy to forget, don’t want to be stranded
Challenges:
How do I know what I need? What are official sources
Check expiration dates
Travel agencies
Why from a user perspective?: Not many users are confident in what to do once they get to the travel destination. 
Challenges:
Which ones are trustworthy
Aligning within schedule
Leisure/Attractions
Why from a user perspective?: Traveling implies fun things 
Challenges:
How do we know what type of activities the user prefers? 
Aligning with schedule
Real-time updates

## Meetings
_On your first meeting with your mentor TA, you should plan dates for at least the following meetings:_

**Specs, Mockup, and Design Meeting:** _(Schedule for on or before March 13)_

**4-Way Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 23)_

**Adversary Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 29 once you are assigned an adversary TA)_

## How to Build and Run
